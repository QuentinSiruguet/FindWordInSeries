## Find Word In Series is a software used to export short scenes of a TV Show.


#### How does it work ?

1 - He'll store all the paths to the files that are in the TV Show folder.

2 - The software will check that the subtracks have not already been extracted.

3 - If so, he'll extract them.

4 - Everytime a sub is extract, he'll check in it for the word.

5 - If he find it, he'll call an export from the start of the subtitle (or the previous if you activated it) and for the length set in the config.cfg

6 - And he'll go to the next subtrack.
